# Online Shopping App

Today I am very excited to share my very first Flutter-based project An online shopping app. 
The app starts with some interactive starting pages to engage users. New users can 'sign up' by filling in their details. Returning users can 'sign in' using Google, Facebook, or other social accounts.
We also have a 'forgot password option' for easy recovery.

# The 'Home page' shows:  
- New Trends,  
- Popular items,  
- Recently viewed products,  
- Brands you may like,
-Saved Item and  
- Suggestions based on user preferences.
  
It also contains Product details page.

# Users can search for products on the 'Search page', with options for both 'men and women'.

# In the 'Cart', users can:  
- See their selected items, can increase quantity and delete product from cart.
- Proceed to the 'checkout page', and  
- View their orders with delivery dates.

# The app also has a 'Saved products section' where users can add items to their favorites for future purchases.

# On the 'Account page', users can:  
- Manage their 'personal information',  
- Change 'settings',  
- Save 'payment methods',  
- Connect to their 'social accounts', and  
- Find 'contact information' for support.  - Sign out option.

This app is simple, fast, and designed to give a smooth shopping experience.
